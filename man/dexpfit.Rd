\value{
A \code{fitteddoubleExp} class object containing the original ProbMat class object, posterior of the growth rate, along with its Gelman Rubin statistic and effective sample sizes.
}
\description{
Fits a double exponential growth model to \code{ProbMat} class objects.
}
\details{
The function fits a discrete bounded double exponential growth model on the observed data using MCMC as implemented by the nimble package. The Bayesian model consists of a two growth rate parameters (r1 and r2), with the change from r1 and r2 occuring at inferred point in time eta. Users can define suitable priors using character strings for the argument \code{rPrior1},\code{rPrior2}, and \code{cPrior} (for details on how this should be specified please consult the nimble manual). Please note that the function returns posterior of the growth rate normalised by the resolution defined in the \code{ProbMat} class object.  MCMC settings such as the choice the sampler, number of iterations, chains, etc can also be specified.
