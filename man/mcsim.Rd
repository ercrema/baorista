\title{Monte-Carlo simulation on aoristic data}
\usage{
mcsim(x, nsim = 1000)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A ProbMat class object}

\item{nsim}{Number of Monte-Carlo simulations}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{mcsimres} containing relevant metadata and a matrix with the number of events per time-block per Monte-Carlo simulation.
}
\description{
Samples multiple sets of random dates from aoristic weights
}
\details{
The function randomly assigns to each event a time-block based on its probability values (i.e. aoristic weight) and computes, for each time-block, the total number of simulated events. This process is repeated \code{nsim} time, allowing to estimate percentile-based intervals on the number of events per time-block (Crema 2012). It should be noted that while this approach accounts for chronological uncertainty, it provides only a description of the sample rather than the underlying population, and can be biased how the underlying archaeological periodisations define the time-spans of each event (see also Crema 2024 for discussion on limitations).
