# baorista  <img src="/logo/logo.png" align="right" />
_baorista_ is an R package that provides a Bayesian inferential tool for analysing time-frequencies of archaeological events associated with time spans typically obtained from relative chronological sequences (e.g. periods and phases) and often analyses using aoristic sums. At its core _baorista_ is a frontend for fitting Bayesian models via the [NIMBLE probabilistic programming language](https://r-nimble.org/). The package is currently in beta development and can be installed using `devtools`:

```
library(devtools)
install_github('ercrema/baorista')
```
For a quick introduction to _baorista_ check the package [vignette](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/ercrema/baorista/blob/main/vignettes/using_baorista.html) as well as the associated [manuscript](https://osf.io/98qkx) and its [github repo](https://github.com/ercrema/beyond_aoristic)

## Funding
The development of this package was funded by a Philip Leverhulme Prize (PLP-2019-304) awarded to E.Crema.
